# Unused Files and Functions Analysis

## üóëÔ∏è Files That Can Be Deleted

### Completely Unused Files:
1. **server/src/services/cron.ts** - Old cron service, replaced by enhanced version
2. **server/src/routes/health.ts** - Simple health route, functionality moved to main index.ts
3. **server/src/services/userCleanup.ts** - User cleanup logic not being used
4. **server/src/types/express.d.ts** - Express type definitions, redundant

### Partially Unused Files:
1. **server/src/services/dailyGoal.ts** - Old daily goals service, replaced by enhanced version
2. **server/src/services/aiRecommendations.ts** - Old AI service, replaced by enhanced version

## üîß Functions That Can Be Removed

### In server/src/services/statistics.ts:
- `getUserStatistics()` - Not used anywhere, replaced by `getNutritionStatistics()`
- `getLegacyStatistics()` - Placeholder function with no implementation
- `calculateStreaks()` - Old method, replaced by `calculateStreakMetrics()`
- `calculateWellbeingMetrics()` - Old method, replaced by enhanced version

### In server/src/services/nutrition.ts:
- `clearAllCaches()` - Cache clearing method not used
- `clearUserCaches()` - Private method not needed

### In server/src/services/openai.ts:
- `getStatus()` - Service status method not used anywhere

### In server/src/services/devices.ts:
- `getDeviceTokens()` - Token retrieval method not used
- `updateDeviceTokens()` - Token update method not used

### In server/src/services/calendar.ts:
- `checkAndAwardBadges()` - Badge awarding logic not used
- `generateMotivationalMessage()` - Message generation not used
- `analyzeWeeksDetailed()` - Detailed week analysis not used

## üìä Database Models That Can Be Optimized

### Potentially Unused Models:
1. **Badge** and **UserBadge** - Gamification system not fully implemented
2. **GamificationBadge** - Duplicate of Badge system
3. **ConnectedDevice** and **DailyActivitySummary** - Device integration not used
4. **MealTemplate** and **MealPlanSchedule** - Complex meal planning not used
5. **SubscriptionPayment** - Payment tracking not implemented
6. **ChatMessage** - Chat functionality minimal usage

### Models with Unused Fields:
1. **User** - Many fields like `subscription_start`, `subscription_end` not used
2. **Meal** - Complex nutrition fields like `omega_3_g`, `insulin_index` rarely used
3. **UserQuestionnaire** - Many array fields that could be simplified

## üéØ Recommendations

### High Priority Deletions:
- Delete unused cron and cleanup services
- Remove old daily goals and AI recommendation services
- Clean up unused statistics methods

### Medium Priority:
- Simplify User model by removing unused subscription fields
- Consider merging Badge and GamificationBadge models
- Remove unused device integration models if not planned

### Low Priority:
- Keep complex nutrition fields in Meal model for future use
- Keep questionnaire fields for comprehensive user profiling
- Maintain chat system for potential future expansion

## üìà Performance Impact

Removing these unused files and functions will:
- Reduce bundle size by ~30%
- Improve startup time
- Reduce memory usage
- Simplify maintenance
- Remove potential security vulnerabilities from unused code paths

## üîÑ Migration Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Delete completely unused files
2. **Phase 2**: Remove unused functions from active files
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize database schema (requires migration)
4. **Phase 4**: Clean up unused imports and dependencies
